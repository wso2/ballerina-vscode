# Type Editor - Test Specification

## Application Overview

The Type Editor feature in WSO2 Integrator: BI allows users to create, edit, and manage custom types including Record types, Enum types, Union types, Service Classes, and Array types.

10. **Verify the source generated:**
    - Open the type source file (or use Type Menu > Source option)
    - Verify the generated Ballerina code for the new type is correct
11. **Verify the diagram:**
    - Verify the diagram shows entity node with `data-testid="entity-head-Address"`
    - Verify the diagram visualization includes the new type
    - Verify type links are displayed correctly (if types reference each other)

**Expected Result:** Type diagram visualization works correctly, new types are added to the diagram, source code is generated, and diagram is updated.

### 23. Nested Type Creation (Description: Add a new type for a record/any type field to open the typeEditor popup)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Type Editor
2. Create or edit a Record type (e.g., "Person")
3. Click on the "Add Field" button
4. Enter "address" in the field name textbox
5. Click on the field type picker
6. Select "Create New Type" or "Record" option
7. Verify the Type Editor popup/dialog is opened for creating a nested type
8. Enter "Address" as the nested type name
9. Add fields to the nested type (e.g., "street", "city", "zipCode")
10. Click on "Save" button in the nested type dialog
11. Verify the nested type is created
12. Verify the field type is set to the nested type (e.g., "Address")
13. Click on "Save" button in the parent type form
14. Verify both types are created and appear in the diagram
15. **Verify the source generated:**
    - Open the type source file (or use Type Menu > Source option)
    - Verify the generated Ballerina code contains:
      - Nested type definition (e.g., `type Address record { ... }`)
      - Parent type with field using nested type (e.g., `Address address;`)
16. **Verify the diagram:**
    - Verify the diagram shows both type nodes
    - Verify the diagram shows a link between parent and nested type
    - Verify `data-testid="entity-link-Person-Address"` is present

**Expected Result:** Nested type is successfully created, source code includes both type definitions, and the diagram shows the relationship between types.

### 24. Verify inline record support (Description: Add inline record via field options)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Type Editor
2. Create or edit a Record type (e.g., "Person")
3. Click on the "Add Field" button
4. Enter "contact" in the field name textbox
5. Click on the field type picker
6. Select "Inline Record" or "Record" option with inline option
7. Verify inline record fields can be added directly
8. Add fields to the inline record (e.g., "email", "phone")
9. Verify the inline record is configured
10. Click on "Save" button
11. Verify the type is updated
12. **Verify the source generated:**
    - Open the type source file (or use Type Menu > Source option)
    - Verify the generated Ballerina code contains:
      - Inline record syntax (e.g., `record { string email; string phone; } contact;`)
13. **Verify the diagram:**
    - Verify the diagram still shows the type node correctly
    - Verify the diagram visualization reflects the inline record field

**Expected Result:** Inline record is successfully added to the type, source code uses inline record syntax, and the diagram is updated.

## Notes

- All test scenarios should verify both source code generation and diagram visualization at the end
- Source verification can be done by opening the type source file or using the Type Menu > Source option
- Diagram verification should check for type nodes using `data-testid="entity-head-[TypeName]"` and type links using `data-testid="entity-link-[Type1]-[Type2]"`
- Test utilities for source and diagram verification are available in the test framework
