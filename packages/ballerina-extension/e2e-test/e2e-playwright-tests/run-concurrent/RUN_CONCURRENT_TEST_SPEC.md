# Concurrent Run - Test Specification

## Application Overview

WSO2 Integrator runs multiple integrations concurrently (wso2/product-integrator#1012).
This suite verifies the cross-integration behavior using a **two-package Ballerina
workspace** template (`data/concurrent_run_workspace`): packages `alpha_runner` and
`beta_runner`, each a long-running automation printing a unique start marker.

The same-integration restart behavior is covered separately by the `run-conflict`
suite (single-package project).

## Harness Notes

- `initTest` accepts an optional `templatePath` (added for this suite) so a suite can
  boot from a custom project template instead of `data/empty_project`.
- The suite disables Do Not Disturb (harness default is on) so notifications render,
  and restores it in `afterAll`.
- Tree item labels are assumed to be the package names (`title` in each package's
  Ballerina.toml is set to the package name to keep labels predictable). If explorer
  labels differ in workspace mode, adjust `openIntegration`.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Run first integration

1. Click `alpha_runner` in the project explorer, then **Run Integration**.
2. Verify "alpha_runner started" appears in the task terminal.

### 2. Run second integration concurrently without prompts

1. Click `beta_runner`, then **Run Integration**.
2. Verify NO VS Code "task is already active / terminate" modal appears
   (guards against task identity collisions — the type `ballerina-run` task
   definition carries `projectRoot` as an identity property).
3. Verify NO "This integration is already running" notification appears.
4. Verify "beta_runner started" appears.

### 3. Both integrations keep running in separate terminals

1. Verify the terminal tabs list shows both "Ballerina Run - alpha_runner" and
   "Ballerina Run - beta_runner" (dedicated panel per task).
2. Switch to the alpha terminal; its output is intact — the second run did not
   kill or steal the first run's terminal.

### 4. Re-running the same integration prompts restart

1. Click `beta_runner`, then **Run Integration** again.
2. Verify the "This integration is already running..." notification appears.
3. Click **No**; verify both integrations are still running.

## Out of scope (manual, see validation guide)

- HTTP listeners on real ports (port liveness via curl) — `run-switch-sample`.
- Force-start timeout path (process ignoring SIGTERM >10 s).
- Debug-alongside-run and stop-one-of-many scenarios.
