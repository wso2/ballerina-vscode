## Gaps

- The "Types" category node in the project explorer has **no click command** —
  clicking the row only expands/collapses. Navigation happens through its inline
  actions: "View Type Diagram" and "Add Type" (`BI.project-explorer.*` commands
  in the wso2-integrator wrapper manifest). Hover the tree item first, then click
  `a.action-label[aria-label*="View Type Diagram"]` / `[aria-label*="Add Type"]`.
- The home button in the webview TopNavigationBar had no `data-testid`/aria-label
  (only an `i.fw-bi-home` icon). Added `data-testid="home-button"` in
  `packages/ballerina-visualizer/src/components/TopNavigationBar/index.tsx` and
  rebuilt the VSIX.
- The "Create New Type" popup is a **nested type editor** — its testids
  (`type-create-save`, `create-from-scratch-tab`, `type-editor-container`, …)
  duplicate the main panel's. Scope all popup locators to `.unq-modal-overlay`
  and use `.last()`.
- The popup Save button needs `click({ force: true })` — a plain click is
  intercepted by the overlay.
- Helper-panel option clicks must be scoped to `.unq-modal-overlay`; a bare
  `getByText('Address', { exact: true })` hits the type node already rendered in
  the diagram behind the panel (this opens Edit Type instead of selecting).
- After clicking a helper-panel option the field input re-renders — poll/expect
  `toHaveValue` instead of reading the value once.
- Saving the popup auto-assigns the newly created type to the field that opened
  the helper panel.
- The optional-field toggle is `vscode-button[title="Set as an Optional Field"]`
  in the field row. Its icon colour flips from
  `g[fill="var(--vscode-descriptionForeground)"]` (inactive) to
  `g[fill="var(--vscode-button-background)"]` (active) — assert the fill
  attribute, not CSS classes.
- In the Edit Type panel the name field (`data-testid="type-name-display"`) is
  **readonly**. Renaming requires clicking the pencil
  (`vscode-button[title="Rename"]`), which swaps in an editable field with its
  own Cancel/Save pair. That rename Save is the *first* Save in the DOM; the
  panel's bottom Save is disabled during rename. Renaming updates all
  references across the project (Order.customer follows the new name).
- Node three-dots menu (`type-node-<Name>-menu`) items: Edit, Source, Delete,
  Focused View. Delete shows a confirmation dialog
  ("Are you sure you want to delete <Name>?") with Cancel/Delete buttons.
