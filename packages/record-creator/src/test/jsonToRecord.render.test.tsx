// L2 (fast, no LS, no VSCode): render an RPC-driven view against a COMMITTED fixture
// captured from the real LS (fixtures/convertJsonToRecord.json, produced + drift-checked
// by jsonToRecord.capture.test.ts). This is the capture-based L2 pattern: the view reads
// the real useRpcContext().rpcClient; we supply a client that returns the captured
// response, so the real component renders realistic data with zero production changes and
// zero runtime deps — fast enough for the PR gate.
