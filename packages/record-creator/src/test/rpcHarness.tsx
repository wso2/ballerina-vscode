// Generic RPC render harness: render a webview view inside the REAL rpc `Context`
// with a caller-supplied `rpcClient`. Views read `useRpcContext().rpcClient` and call
// `rpcClient.getXxxRpcClient().method(...)`; pass a client whose methods delegate to a
// headless rpc-manager (or, for pass-through managers, straight to the L4 LS harness)
// to drive the view against live data — no captured fixtures, no VSCode.

import React, { ReactNode } from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
// Import the context from source (not the ESM-compiled lib, which jest can't load via
// the node_modules symlink). ts-jest transforms this .ts; its only value import is React.
